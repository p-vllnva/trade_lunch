The trade lunches were launched in 2021 by Farid Toubal and Gianluca Orefice.
Its objective is twofold, it is a way to keep economists interested in trade up
to date with the research of their junior fellows and to provide said juniors
with an opportunity to present their research in a relaxed environment.

These presentations are informal, without support and generally not overly
technical.

Monthly meetings scheduled via doodle. In an attempt to maximize senior
attendance, the default dates are Tuesdays and Wednesdays but we can be
flexible.

If the supply of presentation is high, more slots will be added.
