The trade lunches were launched in 2021 by [Gianluca Orefice] and
[Farid Toubal]. The aim of these meetings is twofold, it is a way to keep
economists interested in globalization up to date with the work of their junior
fellows and to provide the young researchers with an opportunity to present
their research in a small committee.

Each lunch, serves as the setting for an informal presentation without support.
These presentations are generally not overly technical and should be seen as an
opportunity to gather valuable feedback on early or in progress work that you
might not feel comfortable presenting in a more formal context yet.

The trade lunch is a monthly event, scheduled via doodle. In an attempt to
maximize senior attendance, you should expect sessions to take place on Tuesdays
or Wednesdays. We will of course try to find another slot to accommodate the
presenter if needed.

`r cook_apetizer("Abtract", "Firms facing higher import competition resort to adaptive strategies to maintain competitiveness. While previous literature focused on general labor effects and reallocation, little is known about self-employed workers. This paper aims to study import competition and outsourcing to solo self-employed. At the aggregate level (EU - NUTS) our preliminary findings reveal that regions facing intensified import competition from China exhibit higher self-employed workers relative to their total workforce, controlling for country, region, and industry characteristics. The next step is to disentangle whether firms are indeed replacing traditional employees with solo self-employed when facing financial hardship, using French administrative data.")`
